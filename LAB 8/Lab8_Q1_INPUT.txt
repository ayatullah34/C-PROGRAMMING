"a, e, i, o, u" are the vovels in English. 
Write a program that counts the vovels in a text entered by the user 
(Input process should be ended using “.”(full stop) character). 
For each vovel your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks. 
(Note: all the characters which user entered must be lower case.
 You can consider the volvels as a=0, e=1, i=2, o=3 and u=4 which helps to use arrays).
