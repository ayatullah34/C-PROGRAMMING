A completed Sudoku puzzle is a 9 × 9 grid (i.e., a two-dimensional array) in which the digits 1 through 9 appear once and only once in each row, each column and each of nine 3 × 3 grids. In the partially completed 9 × 9 grid of Figure row 1, column 1, and the 3 × 3 grid in the upper-left corner of the board each contain the digits 1 through 9 once and only once. We use C’s two-dimensional array row and column-numbering conventions, but we’re ignoring row 0 and column 0 in conformance with Sudoku community conventions.

The typical Sudoku puzzle provides many filled-in cells and many blanks, often arranged in a symmetrical pattern as is typical with crossword puzzles. The player’s task is to fill in the blanks to complete the puzzle. Some puzzles are easy to solve; some are quite difficult, requiring sophisti-cated solution strategies .
